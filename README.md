# 202unsold
Epitech Project, MATHS 202

Suject:
Steven is a suit-seller in Mississippi.Once a year, he gets rid of his unsold stock, selling separately jackets and trousers, at $10, $20, $30, $40 and $50.He’d like to know how much each piece of clothing is likely to yield (expected value and variance).

Steven gave his statistician friend a mission: to deduce from his past results the probability to sell a $xjacket and$ytrousers together. It appears that the probability is always written(a−x)(b−y)(5a−150)(5b−150)(aandbbeing integers greaterthan 50, depending on the economic climate).

Let’s callX,YandZ, respectively, the random variables that represent ’the price of a sold jacket’, ’the price of soldtrousers’ and ’the price of a sold suit’. Given the values ofaandb, your software must print:
•an array summing up the joint law of (X,Y), and the marginal laws of X and Y,
•an array summing up the law of Z,
•expected values and variances of X, Y and Z.

Usage:
./202unsold a b

a is a constant computed from the past results
b is a constant computed from the past results
